Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below are two example entries from our dataset. Each entry consists of the review and its label. The two reviews were written by different customers describing their experience with a sugar-free candy.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Review: Nasty No flavor. The candy is just red, No flavor. Just plain and chewy. I would never buy them again\n",

        "1. Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.\n",
        "2. Use your classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.\n",

We strongly recommend that you take note of how the NumPy numerical library is used in the code provided, and read through the on-line NumPy tutorial. NumPy arrays are much more efficient than Python's native arrays when doing numerical computation. In addition, using NumPy will substantially reduce the lines of code you will need to write.\n",

        "  - `project1.py` contains various useful functions and function templates that you will use to implement your learning algorithms.\n",
        "  - `main.py` is a script skeleton where these functions are called and you can run your experiments.\n",

Note that these tests are provided to help you debug your implementation and are not necessarily representative of the tests used for online grading. Feel free to add more test cases locally to further validate the correctness of your code before submitting to the online graders in the codeboxes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tip**: Throughout the whole notebook, you can assume the NumPy python library is already imported as `np`. In some problems you will also have access to python's `random` library, and other functions you've already implemented.\n",

You are welcome to implement functions locally and run `test.py` to validate basic functionality, and then copy+paste your code into the notebook code boxes before submitting the notebook back on Canvas.
